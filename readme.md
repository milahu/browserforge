# browserforge

html files are inplace-editable documents like [dokieli](https://dokie.li/)
which can be shared over peer-to-peer networking (wifi, bluetooth, sneakernet)

everything runs in the browser

## status

concept

## specs

### inplace-editing

document is a html page
by default, it is read-only (not editable)
when i click "edit" then load the editor
= make the document editable \*in place\* = no page reload

### offline first

aka: local-first, dweb, nocloud

https://github.com/topics/offline-first
https://github.com/topics/local-first
https://github.com/topics/dweb
https://github.com/topics/dapp

because ...

[There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer](https://www.chriswatterston.com/article/success-of-my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker)

![There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer](there-is-no-cloud.jpg)

#### data flow

on the first page load, the full git repo is fetched and stored in the browser (indexeddb or folder api)

now the app can work offline: browser other pages, edit pages, branch/commit/rebase

on future page loads, the app will ask "do you want to fetch updates?"

updates are merged with local changes.
use either the simple conflict-resolution of git,
or a the complex conflict-resolution of CRDT (yjs, automerge, ...).
the problem with CRDT is, it needs lots of memory to store ALL the changes (character-based diff)

also handle schema migrations

##### self-modifying code

code and data - both can be modified with this system,
so it can be called "self-modifying code" (in a good sense, a "good virus")
more precise a "self-modifying browser-app"

Everything you need to know to create offline-first web apps

### html first

javascript is optional
no build steps, no SSR, no markdown

"html is the mother language" -- rich harris, svelte

markdown can be derived from html

browser first, native second https://jasonette.com/

#### qwik framework

https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik - 14K stars

The HTML-first framework. Instant apps of any size with ~ 1kb JS

https://qwik.builder.io/playground/

qwik playground source: https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/tree/main/packages/docs/src/repl

ui framework should be "SSR by default" like qwik
to produce static html pages, which run without javascript.
optional javascript dependencies are lazy-loaded (on demand) to reduce memory footprint of the app

##### builder.io

https://github.com/BuilderIO/builder - 4K stars

https://builder.io/demo

Drag and drop Visual CMS for React, Vue, Angular, and more

Integrate with any site or app. Drag and drop with the components already in your codebase.

#### html as data exchange format

html is useful as a data exchange format
between mobile devices

data flow:

- click on "export app" -> this will download all data to a single html file
- this html file is sent to the other device
- on the other device, open the html file
- this will install the app to the other device

html template:

```html
<html>
<body>

<script>
console.time("parse html");
</script>

<div>hello ...</div>

<pre style="display:none" id="packfile">
UEFDSwAAAAIAABQFkw14nJXLQQrDIBBA0b2nmH2hjHU0DpTSZTc9hI5jE4hJCOb+TY/Q5fvw+64K
EaUKsi9RBsbgfYxUQrmJkji1pNlFSTWbLe26dFCnjvKtMglqKox+COjQWqrM2eZK7BAxm3T0cd3h

TpG9VGaStM6AiEs3HmKaTGzBtKWk9zeCB3D5P95Xd1XrUxzJkyoTSgJOpOQ1955i1qgQcuaRM5tN
...
20 MByte of base64 data
...
</pre>

<div>... world</div>

<script>
console.timeEnd("parse html");

console.time("get innerHTML");
var packfile = document.querySelector("#packfile").innerHTML
console.timeEnd("get innerHTML");

console.time("decode base64");
packfile = atob(packfile);
console.timeEnd("decode base64");
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

benchmark in chrome on a cheap laptop:

```
parse html: 769.47216796875 ms
get innerHTML: 865.382080078125 ms
decode base64: 1356.555908203125 ms
```

the base64 data is generated by

```sh
git gc
# now there is only 1 pack file
cat .git/objects/pack/*.pack | base64 >>pack.html 
```

this is a fusion of multiple tools

> TiddlyWiki is a personal wiki and a non-linear notebook for organising and sharing complex information. It is an open-source single page application wiki in the form of a **single HTML file** that includes CSS, JavaScript, embedded files such as images, and the text content. It is designed to be easy to customize and re-shape depending on application. It facilitates re-use of content by dividing it into small pieces called Tiddlers.
>
> TiddlyWiki is an unusual example of a practical quine. This idea of producing a copy of its own source code that lies at the heart of TiddlyWiki's ability to independently save changes to itself.

An online IDE for rapid web development

https://codesandbox.io/

https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client - 12K stars

<blockquote>

CodeSandbox is less of a playground and more of an online development environment.

Like standard web projects, you can add any number of files and edit them using a multi-tab, VS Code-like integrated development environment (aka IDE). It’s free to sign up using a GitHub or Google account, but you can then collaborate with others in real time, export projects to a Git repository, and deploy to static site hosts such as Netlify and Vercel.

CodeSandbox could be a practical option if you’re working remotely or using a non-typical development device such as a Chromebook.

##### Full Offline Support

https://codesandbox.io/post/creating-a-parallel-offline-extensible-browser-based-bundler-for-codesandbox

<blockquote>
  
Full Offline Support

Everything works offline already, but for full offline support we need to allow you to save sandboxes offline. This allows you to work offline on your projects forever, and upload to CodeSandbox whenever you’d like. The only feature that requires an internet connection are npm dependencies, but we already cache all npm results. We’ll give you the option to precache combinations for when you’re planning a trip or flight.

### book printing

render a book-layout for printing

at the end of the day, digital is just a medium,
and the actual target is always print

todo: latex in javascript? (vanilla javascript, no wasm)

a good layout engine can distribute content across pages
to meet 2 constraints:

1. pretty
2. compact

so, this tool should also be usable as a book-authoring software,
where readers can modify and reprint a book ("editable book")

#### bindery

https://github.com/evnbr/bindery

i tried other tools, but for now im using bindery

its not perfect, sometimes the layout is too compact and ugly,
so i must insert manual pagebreaks ... but it works

## too much

could be useful, but too complex
